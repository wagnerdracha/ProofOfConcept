#      Privilege Escalation - Unquoted Service Paths       #
############################################################

Windows - Samsung Live Wallpaper - LiveWallpaperWindowsService.exe


The service LiveWallpaperWindowsService.exe installed on Samsung's notebook by default is vulnerable to Unquoted Service Paths.

The service LiveWallpaperWindowsService.exe Ã© executed on "NT AUTHORITY\System" (Picture_1.jpg)

To check this vulnerability, access the Windows Services and right click on "Live Wallpaper" service.

Next, click on Properties. On executable path, look that the path is unquoted (Picture_2.jpg)

Vulnerable Path: C:\Program Files\Samsung\Live Wallpaper Service\LiveWallpaperWindowsService.exe

Security Path: "C:\Program Files\Samsung\Live Wallpaper Service\LiveWallpaperWindowsService.exe"

Therefore, when Operating System initiate the Live Wallpaper service, it will try to access the path and the space between "Program" and "Files" words,

it will separate the path in two chunks (like "Live Wallpaper Service" that will separate in three chunks).

The first chunk will be the path to executable and the second path will be an argument.

So in the first chunk the executable will be the word "Program".

Finally, if you have permission the write a executable on C drive with the name Program.exe, or write a executable named Live.exe (Picture_3.jpg) inside Samsung directory,

you will elevate your privilege to "NT AUTHORITY\System".
